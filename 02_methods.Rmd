# MATERIALS AND METHODS

## SURVEY LOCATIONS

Fishing (Figure \@ref(fig:mapfish)), oceanographic (Figure \@ref(fir:mapctd)) and plankton sampling (Figure \@ref(fig:mapplankton)) occurred offshore Triangle Island and in Queen Charlotte Sound, Hecate Strait, and Dixon Entrance. We successfully completed 20 coastal midwater trawls, 2 offshore midwater trawls, 19 CTD casts, 2 rosette casts, 21 vertical plankton tows, 2 oblique plankton tows, and 3 MOCNESS (Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System) tows. In addition, 4 offshore midwater tows and 1 rosette cast were successfully completed during equipment set up and gear testing. All net adjustment tows were done with the codend open to avoid the capture of fish.

## FISHING OPERATIONS

We used two midwater trawl nets, the offshore [NPAFC](https://npafc.org/) LFS 1142 midwater trawl net (Figures \@ref(fig:offshorenet1) to \@ref(fig:offshorenet3)) and coastal LFS 7742 midwater trawl net (Figure \@ref(fig:coastalnet)), manufactured by [LFS Trawl](https://www.lfsinc.com/commericalfishinggear/trawl.htm) (LFS Net Systems, Bellingham, USA). Both trawl nets are two-bridle midwater nets, and have codend liners to retain smaller species (offshore LFS 1142 4 mm and coastal LFS 7742 6.35 mm). The offshore LFS 1142 was designed for [High Seas Expeditions](https://yearofthesalmon.org/high-seas-expeditions/), and has never been deployed from the `r vessel`. We incorporated equipment set up into this survey because gear testing was cancelled due to COVID-19 restictions. The main difference between the offshore and coastal trawl nets is that the offshore net was designed to have a larger net opening. The offshore LFS 1142 net opening was designed to be 46 m wide by 30 m high [@somov2020], or an area of 1380 m^2^. The coastal LFS 7742 was designed to have a net opening of 30 m wide by 15 m high, or an area of 450 m^2^ (Figure \@ref(fig:coastalnet)). Actual net openings varied; therefore, height and width dimensions were recorded for each tow and used in the calculation of catch per swept volume (Table \@ref(tab:bridgetable)). 

Two chain clumps were attached to the footrope with approximately 204 kg (450 lbs) and 340 kg (750 lbs) per chain clump for the coastal and offshore net respectively. [Thybor√∏n](https://thyboron-trawldoor.dk/) Type 15 VF, 4.5 m^2^ mid-water doors (730 kg each) with [Scanmar](https://www.scanmar.no/) SS4 door sensors, were used with both nets. A [Simrad](https://www.kongsberg.com/maritime/) FS70 was used as a third wire trawl sonar to the monitor net opening in real time, and [Scanmar](https://www.scanmar.no/) SS4 clump sensors were attached on the wing tips. In addition, [RBR duet^3^ temperature and depth sensors](https://rbr-global.com/products/compact-loggers/rbrduet-td) (RBR Ltd., Ottawa, ON, Canada) were attached to the headrope and footrope to record depth every 30 seconds. The vertical net opening was calculated from the difference between the two depth. These depths were plotted over time to show the net opening and depth in order to improve consistency between tows.

Tow speed varied between 6.1 to 9.6 km/hour (3.3 and 5.2 knots) speed over ground, depending on the wind, tide, and current, in order to reach the target headrope depth. The target headrope depths were 0 m (surface) and 15 m (depth). Two A-6 floats 86.4 cm x 118.1 cm (34" x 46.5") were attached to sixth blue knot on headrope for surface tows. Warp length ranged from 190-200 m for surface tows, and 227 to 243 m for 15 m hearope depth tows.

## OCEANOGRAPHY

At coastal stations, up to 24 bottle rosette casts with 911 CTD to 10 m or 


## PLANKTON

At plankton stations (Figure \@ref(fig:mapplankton)), vertical plankton (bongo) tows were conducted to approximately 250 m or within 10 m of the bottom with two 60 cm diameter, 250 micrometer mesh bongo nets. Plankton collected from the flow meter side were preserved in 10% formalin and sent to the plankton laboratory at the Institute of Ocean Sciences, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Sidney, BC) for species classification and enumeration.  The remaining plankton sample was sorted into four size fractions by successively sieving through 8.0, 1.7, 1.0, and 0.25 mm screens. Individual size fractions were frozen for future stable isotope, bomb calorimetric, and proximate analyses. 

Vertical zooplanton tows were completed at all stations, however, two additional oblique plankton tows were attempted at two offshore stations (CS01, T01). The vessel speed was controlled to allow a 45 degree wire angle to increase the volume of water sampled. Oblique plankton tows are a method under consideration for the 2022 Pan-Pacific High Seas Expedition.

The MOCNESS was deployed at three stations (CS01, MT08, Mason53) from the starboard side of the vessel. The vessel speed was controlled to allow a 45 degree angle on the wire. The net was open during descent to 300-500 m, depending on the starting bottom depth. The five additional strata were sampled during ascent, with the depth strata depending on the maximum depth and acoustic signals.
