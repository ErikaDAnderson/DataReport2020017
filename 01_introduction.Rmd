# Introduction

The Basin and Coastal Scale Interactions Program (formerly Highseas Program) of Fisheries and Oceans has conducted ecosystem-based annual  surveys targeting juvenile Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus* spp.) on the continental shelf off British Columbia since 1995. The main objectives of these surveys were to collect information on (1) the abundance, distribution, and ecology of juvenile Pacific salmon that are in their first year at sea, (2) the prevailing oceanography, and (3) the distribution and biomass of zooplankton.   

This report documents the data collected on the survey from `r surveyDateRange` on the `r vessel`. Biological and oceanographic sampling was conducted 

An additional objective of this survey was to optimize offshore sampling gear and protocols for the [2022 Pan-Pacific High Seas Expedition](https://yearofthesalmon.org/high-seas-expeditions/).
