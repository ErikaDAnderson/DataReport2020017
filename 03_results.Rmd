On this survey, the offshore LFS 1142 mouth opening averaged 54 m horizontally x 25 m vertically (area of 1350 m^2^), compared to the coastal net which averaged 17 m by 47 m vertically (area of 800 m^2^) during surface tows. This measurements is less than previous surveys where the offshore LFS mouth openning averaged 19 m vertically by 44 m horizontally at the surface, or area of (836 m^2^)
