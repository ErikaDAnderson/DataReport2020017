# DISCUSSION

This ecosystem-based juvenile salmon survey collected valuable information on distribution, abundance, condition, and genetic stock composition (GSI) for juvenile salmon in the north coast of British Columbia. Overall, juvenile chum and pink salmon were most abundant, whereas chinook salmon were least abundant. Distributions and stomach contents varied by species. We collected physical oceanographic water profiles, and plankton abundance and composition associated with the salmon caught. As it becomes available, the data from laboratory analysis (i.e. GSI, energy density, plankton composition) will be integrated into the survey data. Catch, condition and preliminary GSI will be presented at the [State of the Pacific Ocean](https://dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/publications/index-eng.html#soto-pac-tech) meeting in March 2021, and the data will be used to support the Fraser River Sockeye Forecasting supplement produced annually [@macdonald2020]. 

Offshore gear and protocols were tested during this survey. The offshore LFS 1142 trawl net was deployed for the first time on the *`r vessel`*. Three MOCNESS and two oblique plankton tows were successfully conducted off the starboard in calm waters. The LARS winch system for the rosette and 911 CTD was used at two stations.
